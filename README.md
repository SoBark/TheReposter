# The reposter

## Overview

Studing project with following goals:

- practice in software design
- get handy with docker 
- use server framework

## Application

App must have following properties:

- independent backend and frontend
- telegram bot
- web application
- only one user (due to problems with vicious cycles)

### Backend

- create links
- repost from choosen social pages to other social pages
    - do not self repost (seems not so easy, if amount of users more than one, but probably enough to check if tree has not any cycle)

### Frontend

**TODO**
